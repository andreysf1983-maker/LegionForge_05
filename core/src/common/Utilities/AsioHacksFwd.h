// Boost.Asio 1.66+ changed the template signatures of basic_resolver and
// basic_deadline_timer (the *_service template parameters were removed).
// Hand-written forward declarations of those templates no longer match the
// real ones and cause redeclaration errors as soon as a translation unit also
// includes the genuine Asio headers. Include the real headers instead - they
// provide ip::address, ip::tcp, tcp::endpoint, tcp::resolver and deadline_timer.
